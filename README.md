Number guessing game

A small application written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS that represents a number guessing game. The player has to guess a number between 1 and 20, having 20 guesses available. Whenever the player chooses a number, the game will tell if that number is either too low or too high, helping the player. There is also a highscore that keeps track of how many guesses the player neeeded in order to find the correct number. The lower the amount of guesses used, the higher highscore will be. The code editor used was Visual Studio Code.
